THE 7 BEST ROBOT VACUUMS FOR EVERY BUDGET
From no-frills cleaners to high-end automation, we have the ideal robovac for you.
Let’s be honest: A lot of tech is meant to stoke desire for something that you never even knew you wanted (An AI camera? Yes, please! A robot that
 coos when you pet it? Gimme!)
 But if you’re shopping for a robot vacuum, it’s usually because you really, really need one. Whether you’re drowning in dog hair, need to lighten 
your chore load, or just want to spend a little more time with your family, we have a robot vacuum for you. Updated March 2019: We added several robot vacuums, 
such as the Roborock E20, added new info to the writeups, and cut a few older units.

BEST IN CLASS

Roomba i7+ Robot Vacuum
PRICE
$1099
iRobot's Roomba i7+ solves one of the most pressing robovac pain points: It can empty its own bin. This is in addition to smart maps that let you
 map up to 10 different floor plans. In iRobot's simple app, you can designate different zones in each floor plan, then remotely send the i7+ to tidy
 up the foyer and bathroom while leaving the cluttered bedrooms untouched. It also has updated navigation tech and a proprietary rubber carpet 
agitator to grab grime. If you can justify spending a month's rent on a home appliance, this is it.

BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
Roborock
Roborock E20
PRICE
$330
The Roborock E20 is an affordable mop-and-vacuum bot combo, but you get oh, so much more than an auto-Swiffer. It has features that I've previously 
only found in high-end robot vacuums, like mapping capabilities and the ability to watch it clean in real-time in the app. It can automatically 
edge-clean and navigate around obstacles without banging doors shut or scaring your cats. It also has other delightful extras, like a thumb controller 
for the remote instead of tapping buttons.

BEST DEEP CLEAN
Neato Robotics
Botvac D7 Connected
PRICE
$829
Neato's premium D7 Connected has seen considerable improvements since our review. Rather than taping magnetic boundaries all around your house,
 you can draw no-go lines on your phone's touchscreen. It can also store multiple floor plans for multi-story houses, and it has zone cleaning so that
 you can send it to tidy up the kitchen after you're done baking. It can also calculate exactly how long it needs to recharge in order to finish cleaning,
 instead of charging for the full hour. It's amazingly powerful, fast, smart, and effective. Just keep it on gentle navigation if you don't want it to break
 its own bump sensors.

BEST CLUTTER NAVIGATOR
iRobot
Roomba 980
PRICE
$799
One of the most annoying parts of robot vacuuming is having to pick up all the loose ribbons and Legos that might trip up a cleaning cycle. The
 Roomba 980 eliminates that problem by circling around all the stuffed animals that you can't bear to put away right now. It also has iRobot's 
proprietary rubber carpet agitator and is heavy and large enough to suck dirt on carpets, especially with iRobot’s uncannily accurate Dirt Detect system. The Roomba maps are the best, and the virtual wall system is the most convenient and least obtrusive. But it is loud, and expensive.

BEST DIRT DETECTIVE
iRobot
Roomba 690
PRICE
$299
Many households use robot vacuums for a quick, automated clean. But if you, too, have kids that grind croissant crumbs into the carpet, you need
 iRobot's Dirt Detect feature. We still think our mid-range fave is a great pick. Along with Dirt Detect, it has many of the same features as its more 
expensive brethren, like the same easy-to-use app and invisible wall barrier system. A few downgrades were inevitable—instead of the 980’s powerful
 AeroForce cleaning technology, the 690 has an earlier iteration called AeroVac, and the wonderful rubber carpet agitator was swapped for a boring, 
but effective carpet brush. But these are acceptable trade-offs for being able to pocket more dough.

BEST FOR SMALL SPACES
Eufy
Robovac 35C
PRICE
$300
Eufy's slim, small robot vacuums are the easiest to use. The 35C is the latest, and at less than three inches tall, it's small enough to store under the
 couch and scootch under the lowest cupboards. But it still packs a punch, with up to 1,500 Pa of suction power and optional BoostIQ when it hits a 
particularly grody spot. The app is simple and attractive and includes features like scheduling, a remote, and a locator. I highly recommend an app, 
but if you don't think you need one, the 11+ and 11S are also affordable picks for light daily cleaning.

ALSO A GREAT PICK
Neato Robotics
Botvac D4 Connected
PRICE
$430
If you love Neato's powerful cleaning capabilities and easy-to-use app, but balk at the price, you are not alone. Neato's D4 Connected is one of our 
faves. Like the D7, the D4 Connected creates a floor map and lets you install virtual no-go boundaries. With Gentle Navigation toggled on, it doesn't
 bash into doors or climb into dog bowls, and as always, Neato's clean, straight lines across our low-pile carpets and rugs never fail to impress.
